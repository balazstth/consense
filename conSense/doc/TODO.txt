TODO
----

- [0022] [2018-10-09] Release minifier temporarily disabled, TODO: find one that supports ES6
- [0021] [2018-10-09] BUG: when Ctrl+clicking an anchor link the new tab cannot load
                      url#anchor since #... denotes an article to be loaded. Works in
                      the original page though (simple clicking of the link).

+ [0015] [2018-10-01] AJAX loader, investigate if it can completely replace the IFrame
                      loader. If so, make it invisible through RedSendGenericLoader.
                      That might bring back full IE compatibility, too.
+ [0017] [2018-10-04] Load timeout handling
+ [0004] [2018-09-23] Include in an include: the ability to load content from within a loaded
                      content. E.g. load injectCommand.js directly from intro.txt, not from
                      index.html
+ [0005] [2018-09-23] Warning message in FF when dynamically loading content:
                      "The character encoding of a framed document was not declared.
                      The document may appear different if viewed without the document
                      framing it."
                      An ability to set encoding and MIME type for loaded files.

~ [0019] [2018-10-04] RedSand/OS: Windowing system with text mode or empty windows,
                      an evolution of windowlets. Materialize? Velocity? Backbone?
~ [0008] [2018-09-23] RedSandText: new feature, text mode windows
                      an old school text mode interface to implement an editor or anything
                      (Maybe BiturboVision?)
~ [0018] [2018-09-23] RedSandAutoMenu: Dynamically populated navigation menus for RedSand
~ [0006] [2018-09-23] RedSand/GL: vector and pixel features in windowlets
~ [0007] [2018-09-23] RedSand/GL: game loop
~ [0020] [2018-10-04] Dice roller with CSS 3D
                      URL parameters to determine dice to roll

Done
----
x [0003] [2018-09-23] LightDown on loaded pages, e.g. in the Tests article
x [0010] [2018-09-27] Option / default to skip the cache when dynamically loading !
x [0001] [2018-09-23] Reloading the page does not reload content
x [0002] [2018-09-23] Fix dynamic content loading in Chrome
                      (It was the onLoad callback being called before adding a src URL to the
                      new IFrame.)
x [0012] [2018-09-30] Won't fix: hasOwnProperty() list() in ConSense, show only own properties
x [0014] [2018-10-01] Page reload sometimes does not reload the dynamic content
x [0009] [2018-09-27] Won't fix: Responsive design for mobile screens.
                          Comes naturally with Materialize or another framework.
x [0016] [2018-10-01] Won't fix, covered in [0019]:
                      Thinking about including Materialize and Velocity
x [0011] [2018-09-30] Covered in [0008]: BiturboVision as a TurboVision port?
